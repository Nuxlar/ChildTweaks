# Child Tweaks

## Reworks Frolic (teleport)

- Frolic is now directional (think Huntress' long blink but shorter range)
- Frolic is now a skill (this is more internal, but it's more predictable)
- Frolic is no longer triggered when taking damage
- Frolic no longer adds invincibility

## Tweaks Spark Ball (projectile)

- Spark Ball damage is reduced 600% -> 200%
- Spark Ball no longer grows visually, size remains consistent
- Spark Ball no longer slows down, speed remains consistent
- Spark Ball now has custom flight SFX for better sound cues
- Reduced Spark Ball spawn distance (spawns closer to Child to prevent unfair hits)
- Increased Spark Ball max activation distance 37 -> 45 (now activates ability farther away)
- Decresed Spark Ball min activation distance 25 -> 15 (now activates ability closer to prevent constant running away)

## General Tweaks

- Child spawn cost reduced 35 -> 25 (blind pests are 15 for reference)
- Slight AI tweaks for more sprinting and navigation
- Adds EnemyImportance as a dependency to prevent instances of Child blinking into walls or the floor
